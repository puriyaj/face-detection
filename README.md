# Face Detection with React, Vite, and TensorFlow.js

## Project Overview

This project is a web application built with React, Vite, and TensorFlow.js that performs real-time face detection. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow.js, this app demonstrates how to integrate machine learning models into a React application to detect faces in images or live video feeds.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using TensorFlow.js
- Easy integration with React and Vite
- Live video feed processing
- Minimal setup and configuration

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server
- **TensorFlow.js**: A library for machine learning in JavaScript
